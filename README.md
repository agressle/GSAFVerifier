# GSAFVerifier
A tool for verifying RUP-style inconsistency proofs for abstract argumentation frameworks with collective attacks (SETAF).

## 1 Installation

Requires the rust toolchain (c.f. https://www.rust-lang.org and https://rustup.rs). Run 'cargo build â€“release' to build. 

## 2 Usage 

Usage: verifier [OPTIONS] --instance `<FILE>` --proof `<FILE>` --semantics `<SEMANTICS>`

Options:
  * -i, --instance `<FILE>`\
     A file that contains the encoding of the instance, see also: [instance file format](https://github.com/agressle/GSAFSolver#instance-file-format).
  * -d, --description `<FILE>`\
     A file that contains the instance description, see also: [description file format](https://github.com/agressle/GSAFSolver#description-file-format).
  * -p, --proof `<FILE>`\
     A file that contains the proof.
  * -r, --required `<FILE>`\
     A file that contains the required arguments, see also: [required arguments file format](https://github.com/agressle/GSAFSolver#required-arguments-file-format).  
  * -s, --semantics `<SEMANTICS>`\
     The semantics that the proof adheres to. [possible values: Admissible, ConflictFree, Stable]
  * -t, --timeout `<TIMEOUT>`\
     The timeout in seconds 0 for no limit. [default: 0]
  * -w, --threads `<THREAD>`\
     The number of verifier threads to use. [default: 1]
  * -u, --used\
     When provided, indices of the attacks and clauses that where used during verification are printed.
  * -c, --complete\
     When provided, all clauses of the proof are verified. Otherwise, only those used for propagation are verified.
